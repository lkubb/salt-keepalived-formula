      # The files_switch key serves as a selector for alternative
      # directories under the formula files directory. See TOFS pattern
      # doc for more info.
      # Note: Any value not evaluated by `config.get` will be used literally.
      # This can be used to set custom paths, as many levels deep as required.

      - any/path/can/be/used/here
      - id
      - roles

      - os
      - os_family

      # All aspects of path/file resolution are customisable using the options below.
      # This is unnecessary in most cases; there are sensible defaults.
      # Default path: salt://< path_prefix >/< dirs.files >/< dirs.default >
      # I.e.: salt://keepalived/files/default
      # path_prefix: template_alt
      # dirs:
      #   files: files_alt
      #   default: default_alt
      # The entries under `source_files` are prepended to the default source files
      # given for the state

      keepalived configuration is managed:
